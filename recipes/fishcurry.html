    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Fish curry, or Meen Curry, is a vibrant and aromatic dish that is a staple across the coastal regions of South
        and Southeast Asia, with famous variations hailing from Kerala, Goa, and Bengal. This comforting dish typically
        features firm white fish—such as cod, snapper, or kingfish—simmered in a rich, complex sauce. The base of the
        sauce often combines tangy elements like tamarind or tomato with warming spices, including turmeric, chili
        powder, and fenugreek. In many regional styles, coconut milk is added to provide a creamy, luxurious mouthfeel,
        balancing the heat and sourness of the curry.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>1 lb Firm White Fish Fillets (such as Cod, Snapper, or Kingfish)</li>
  <li>1 medium Onion (chopped or sliced)</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Ginger paste</li>
  <li>1 tbsp Garlic paste</li>
  <li>A sprig of fresh Curry Leaves</li>
  <li>1 tsp Turmeric Powder</li>
  <li>2 tsp Coriander Powder</li>
  <li>1 tsp Cumin Powder</li>
  <li>1-2 tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder (for color and moderate heat)</li>
  <li>1 can (13.5 oz) Full-fat Coconut Milk</li>
  <li>2 tbsp Tamarind Pulp or 1/2 cup chopped Tomato (for acidity)</li>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Cooking Oil</li>
  <li>Water (as needed to adjust consistency)</li>
  <li>Fresh Cilantro and Green Chilies (for garnish)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Fish:</strong> Clean, wash, and cut the fish into suitable pieces. Marinate lightly with turmeric powder, salt, and maybe a dash of lemon juice (optional) for 15 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Heat oil (or coconut oil) in a pot or clay dish. Add mustard seeds (optional) and let them splutter. Add curry leaves, chopped onions, and sauté until the onions are soft.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Pastes:</strong> Stir in the ginger and garlic paste and sauté for about one minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
  <li><strong>Temper Spices:</strong> Reduce the heat. Add all the powdered spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili powder). Sauté briefly for 30 seconds to 1 minute, being careful not to burn them.</li>
  <li><strong>Build the Gravy Base:</strong> Add the tamarind pulp (mixed with water) or chopped tomatoes. Add salt. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the tomatoes or tamarind have melded into the spice mix and the oil starts separating from the sides.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Coconut Milk:</strong> Pour in the full-fat coconut milk and required amount of water to achieve desired gravy consistency. Bring the gravy to a gentle simmer (do not boil rapidly).</li>
  <li><strong>Cook the Fish:</strong> Gently place the marinated fish pieces into the simmering gravy. Cover and cook on low to medium heat for about 5 to 8 minutes, or until the fish is flaky and fully cooked through. Stir gently or shake the pot to avoid breaking the fish pieces.</li>
  <li><strong>Finish and Garnish:</strong> Check and adjust salt and tanginess if needed. Garnish with fresh cilantro and slit green chilies.</li>
  <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the curry rest for 10-15 minutes before serving (flavors deepen as it rests). Serve hot with steamed rice or bread.</li>
