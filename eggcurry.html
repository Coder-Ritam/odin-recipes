    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>The dish features several hard-boiled eggs that have been sliced in half and are submerged in a thick, rich
        reddish-orange gravy. The curry appears to be tomato and onion-based, characterized by its deep color derived
        from spices like turmeric, chili powder, and garam masala.

        The gravy has a smooth, slightly creamy texture, suggesting it may contain a thickening agent like cashew paste,
        yogurt, or coconut milk, though it lacks the bright yellow hue often associated with heavy cream or coconut. The
        dish is garnished generously with fresh, chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) and includes visible pieces of
        sliced green chilies and possibly ginger slivers, which add freshness and a hint of heat.

        It is presented in a round, rustic white bowl and looks ready to be served hot with rice or bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
  <li>Hard-boiled Eggs (4-6, depending on serving size)</li>
  <li>Oil or Ghee</li>
  <li>Onions (finely chopped or pureed)</li>
  <li>Tomatoes (pureed or finely chopped, for the gravy base)</li>
  <li>Ginger-Garlic Paste (or fresh ginger and garlic)</li>
  <li>Whole Spices: Cumin Seeds, Bay Leaf, Cardamom Pods, Cinnamon Stick (optional)</li>
  <li>Powdered Spices:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Turmeric Powder</li>
      <li>Kashmiri Red Chili Powder (for deep color) or Regular Chili Powder</li>
      <li>Coriander Powder</li>
      <li>Cumin Powder</li>
      <li>Garam Masala</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Salt, to taste</li>
  <li>Water or Broth (to adjust gravy consistency)</li>
  <li>Yogurt or Cream (optional, for richness)</li>
  <li>Fresh Cilantro (for garnish)</li>
  <li>Green Chilies (slit, for flavor and heat)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Prepare the Eggs:</strong> Hard-boil the eggs. Once cooled, peel them and make small slits or pricks on the surface of each egg.</li>
  <li><strong>Sauté Eggs (Optional):</strong> Heat a teaspoon of oil/ghee in a pan. Add a pinch of turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Briefly roll the hard-boiled eggs in this spice mix until lightly golden, then set them aside.</li>
  <li><strong>Start the Gravy Base:</strong> In the same pan (or a pot), heat oil or ghee. Add whole spices like cumin seeds and bay leaf. Once the cumin splutters, add the finely chopped or pureed onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Aromatics:</strong> Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and sauté for about one minute until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
  <li><strong>Temper Powdered Spices:</strong> Reduce the heat to low. Add the powdered spices (turmeric, coriander, cumin, and chili powder). Cook for 30 seconds to release the fragrance, ensuring the spices do not burn.</li>
  <li><strong>Cook the Tomatoes:</strong> Add the tomato puree or chopped tomatoes and salt. Cook the mixture thoroughly until the tomatoes are soft, the gravy thickens, and the oil starts to separate from the sides (this is crucial for flavor).</li>
  <li><strong>Simmer the Gravy:</strong> Add water or broth to achieve the desired gravy consistency. Bring the curry to a rolling boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Add Eggs and Finish:</strong> Gently add the prepared hard-boiled eggs (with slits) to the simmering gravy. Stir in garam masala and, optionally, a spoonful of heavy cream or yogurt for richness.</li>
  <li><strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Cook for another 2-3 minutes to allow the eggs to absorb the gravy flavor. Garnish generously with fresh chopped cilantro and slit green chilies before serving hot with rice or bread.</li>
