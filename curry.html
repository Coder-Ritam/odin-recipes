    <h3>Steps to prepare Butter Chicken Masala</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Cut the boneless chicken into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Combine yogurt/curd, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, and a mix of spices (Kashmiri chili powder,
                    garam masala, turmeric, salt).</li>
                <li>Coat the chicken thoroughly in the marinade and refrigerate for a minimum of 30 minutes, or
                    preferably several hours/overnight.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cook the Chicken:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat oil or a mix of oil and butter in a pan, skillet, or grill.</li>
                <li>Cook the marinated chicken pieces until they are browned and nearly cooked through (they will finish
                    cooking in the sauce).</li>
                <li>Remove the cooked chicken from the pan and set it aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare the Makhani Gravy Base:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>In the same pan (or a new pot), melt butter and add whole spices (like cinnamon stick, cardamom
                    pods, and cloves) until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add chopped onions (optional) and sauté until soft and translucent.</li>
                <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and powdered spices (like Kashmiri chili powder, coriander, and turmeric).
                    Cook for about one minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Add tomato puree/crushed tomatoes, salt, and raw cashew nuts (for thickness and creaminess).</li>
                <li>Simmer the mixture until the tomatoes break down and the oil starts to separate.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Blend and Strain the Gravy:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the whole spices (optional, but recommended for a smooth texture).</li>
                <li>Transfer the cooked gravy mixture to a blender and blend until completely smooth.</li>
                <li><strong>For a restaurant-style smoothness:</strong> Pass the blended gravy through a fine-mesh
                    strainer back into the cooking pot, discarding any solids left in the strainer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Simmer and Finish:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring the strained gravy to a gentle simmer.</li>
                <li>Add sugar (to balance the acidity) and a generous pinch of crushed **Kasuri Methi** (dried fenugreek
                    leaves).</li>
                <li>Add the pre-cooked chicken pieces and simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the chicken to absorb the
                    sauce.</li>
                <li>Stir in the heavy cream and a final knob of butter (this is the "butter" part of the butter
                    chicken!).</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust salt, sugar, or spice level as needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Serve:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and a swirl of cream.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with Naan, Roti, or Basmati Rice.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
